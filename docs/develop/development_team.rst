Development Team Members
------------------------

Below is a list of people who have contributed to MELODIES MONET along with 
their current and future development goals.

**Rebecca Schwantes:**
I am a research scientist at CIRES/NOAA CSL coordinating the 
development of MELODIES MONET. My development plans include incorporating 
additional surface observational datasets, adding the capability of pairing 
to aircraft observations, and expanding plotting and statistics for analysis 
of aircraft data.
