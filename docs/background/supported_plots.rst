Model to Model Comparisons
--------------------------
Under development.

project on Github to learn about current and future development.

Model to Observations Comparisons
---------------------------------

Surface Evaluation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   * **Timeseries** - Plot comparing one or more model results with one 
     observation (y-axis) versus time (x-axis) over the analysis window with 
     options to specify the domain, time (local or UTC), and averaging window.
   * **Taylor** - Taylor plot comparing one or more model results with one 
     observation over the analysis window with options to specify the domain.
   * **Spatial Bias** - Difference plot of model - observations averaged over 
     the analysis window with options to specify the domain.
   * **Spatial Overlay** - Model results in contours with observational 
     results overlaid in markers averaged over the analysis window with 
     options to specify the domain.
   * **BOX-plot** - BOX-plot comparing one or more model results with one 
     observation over the analysis window with options to specify the domain.
   
Adding an option to plot regulatory metrics like MDA8 ozone is under 
development.
