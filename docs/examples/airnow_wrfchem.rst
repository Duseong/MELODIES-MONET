Evaluate AirNow and WRF-Chem
==============================

Our first example will demonstrate the basics available in MELODIES MONET to 
compare WRF-Chem model results against AirNow surface observations for ozone, 
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and PM :subscript:`2.5`.

Please download the WRF-Chem example model dataset from [need to find good 
flexible repository for this. Look into NOAA ftp?].
